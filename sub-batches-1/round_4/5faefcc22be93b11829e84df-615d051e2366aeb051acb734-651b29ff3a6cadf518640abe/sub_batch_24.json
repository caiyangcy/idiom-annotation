In the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, Beijing's pre-emptive deterrence did not succeed, and was even once weighed down by舆论调度, so the encirclement exercises had to be earth-shattering in order to demonstrate China's increased determination, while also highlighting the self-restraint of the United States and Taiwan after being deterred. However, by this year's 'Tsai-Ma meeting', the deterrence effect of the previous encirclement exercises was still there, and the narrative of 'downgrading' had already taken shape even before the exercises. At present, China does not have an urgent need to respond to舆论 and increase its deterrence, so the exercises do not need to break records as they did last year, as the purpose of this time is not to be earth-shattering, but to maintain the existing narrative and intensity of deterring the collusion between the United States and Taiwan. Of course, this does not mean that Beijing has abandoned its efforts to 'cut off the sausage' in the Taiwan Strait. But there are many tools available in中美博弈, whether it is military display or political negotiation, their essence is just means, and China's national interests are the ultimate goal."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 虹销雨霁\n### Meaning: 虹彩虹；销同消”，消失；霁本指雨止，也引申为天气放睛。彩虹消失，雨后天睛。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
