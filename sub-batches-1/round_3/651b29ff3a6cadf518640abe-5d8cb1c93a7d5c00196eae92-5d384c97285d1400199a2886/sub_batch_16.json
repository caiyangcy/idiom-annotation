Not only did they play across land, sea and air, but they also earned money to pay for their expenses by selling Hong Kong-style egg tarts arranged by the production team. Ah Boy called out loudly throughout the trip, while Arthur lost himself to his \"wanderlust\" nature. The first two episodes to be aired today and tomorrow show Arthur and Ah Boy, who were cheerful when they set off, being forced by the production team to \"start filming\" as soon as they landed. The two of them had no script or any information, and they began their 8-day \"adventure\" journey. Their first task was to challenge the \"luxurious sea view picnic\". Just looking for a suitable location and food made their feet ache. During this time, they even encountered monkey thieves who destroyed the famous duck meat that they had worked hard to obtain, forcing them to \"return to the starting point and set off again\"."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 遥遥无期\n### Meaning: 形容达到目的、实现理想的时间还相距很远。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
