This joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea, on the surface, the hypothetical enemy is North Korea, but considering the location of the exercise is close to the Liaodong Peninsula and Shandong Peninsula, and only 1000 kilometers from Beijing, it must inevitably cause the Chinese to feel that “Xiangzhuang danced his sword, which was aimed at Pei Gong”."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 石破天惊\n### Meaning: 唐李贺《李凭箜篌引》：“女娲炼石补天处，石破天惊逗秋雨。”形容乐声高亢激越，有惊天动地之势。后多用以比喻某一事物或文章议论新奇惊人。\n**The meaning above is for reference.

When Perry visited Taiwan, Beijing's pre-emptive warning wasn't fully successful and the media manipulation had already been done, so the military exercise had to be a shocker, to demonstrate Beijing's willingness to increase the scale of its military presence, but now the military exercise does not have to break records, as the objective is not to shock, but to maintain the already-established narrative and force of the threat to US-Taiwan coalition. However, this doesn't mean Beijing is giving up on the efforts to'slash the turkey' in the Taiwan Sea, because the 中美 chessboard contains many available tools, whether military display or political negotiation, they're all means, China's national interests are the final goal."}]
