Different from the Song Dynasty's pursuit of unconstrained artistic conception, the Yuan Dynasty's intention was to deliberately pursue the beauty of craftsmanship. Therefore, Su Shi advocated \"My calligraphy is original and lawless,\" while Zhao Mengfu promoted \"The use of the brush is unchanging for a thousand years.\" The former pursued spontaneous intention, while the latter emphasized deliberate intention. The core figure in the Yuan Dynasty's calligraphy circle was Zhao Mengfu. His regular script, known as \"Zhao Style,\" along with the \"Ou Style,\" \"Yan Style,\" and \"Liu Style\" of Tang Dynasty regular script, was known as the \"Four Styles,\" and became the main calligraphy style for future generations to imitate."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 声振林木\n### Meaning: 形容歌声或乐器声高亢宏亮。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
