Culturally speaking, Japan can be said to be a country full of gods. According to the video shared by CHEAP, there were many novels or records about monsters or gods in China in the past, such as Shan Hai Jing, Liaozhai, etc. The book of the gods, but because China, the land of China, has been a centralized system since ancient times, it must show the story of the mainstream system defeating evil spirits. As a result, Chinese monsters are often tied hand and foot, and in the end they can only be trapped by traditional society. The mainstream side defeats or conquers it. For example, in Journey to the West, there are no monsters that can defeat Sun Wukong. But Japan's monster culture is different, because Japan is a country with beautiful mountains, rivers and boring... Well, it is a country with dense mountains, rivers, water sources, dense forests, and various natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanoes, so it has been a country since ancient times.
