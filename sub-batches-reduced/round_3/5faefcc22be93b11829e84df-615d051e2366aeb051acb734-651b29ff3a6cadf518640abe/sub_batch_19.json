Her dad took out that poster with her photo on it. It couldn't be denied that her heartache was overwhelming. She wasn't trying to reduce the burden on the family, but she had just adopted an inappropriate way. Of course, if this happened in a big city where people are冷漠, it wouldn't be a big deal.

So her behavior was labeled unforgivable, which made Lin Meimei very upset. She couldn't find words to defend herself and felt like she was about to be thrown eggs at. Suddenly, she realized that her dad seemed to be a lot more沧桑. It turned out that without her knowing it, what she had betrayed was not only her conscience but also the family's high expectations.唉, but what can you do now that it's come to this?"}, {"context": "### Idiom: 牛溲马勃\n### Meaning: 牛溲牛尿，一说车前草，利小便；马勃可治疮。比喻一般人认为无用的东西，在懂得其性能的人手里可成为有用的物品。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
