As a result, Chinese monsters are often tied hand and foot, and in the end they can only be trapped by traditional society. The mainstream side defeats or conquers it. For example, in Journey to the West, there are no monsters that can defeat Sun Wukong. But Japan's monster culture is different, because Japan is a country with beautiful mountains, rivers and boring...
