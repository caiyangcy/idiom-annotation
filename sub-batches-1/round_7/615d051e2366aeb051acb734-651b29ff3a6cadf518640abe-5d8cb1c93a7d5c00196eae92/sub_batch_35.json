He said that writing history was the only way he could express his eternal resistance to an unjust regime. \"We must leave this spirit as a witness to history. History is written like this, and history is written by so many people who have paid their lives and youth for it. This history cannot be forgotten. But forgetting history is the ability of rulers. They teach us to give up historical thinking and only look forward.\" On August 16, 2020, Yang Bichuan said that the late President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, whom he greatly respected, once said that Vietnam must first pursue independence, and only after independence could it possibly implement Marxism. If the Taiwanese people cannot hold the concept of \"fighting and building the country at the same time,\" Taiwan's independence will be far off. If Taiwan has not been independent before he dies, he \"will stand to die, and not lie to die.\" Please refer to the Taiwan Combined Data Repository for more information."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 清灰冷火\n### Meaning: 没吃没喝。常用以形容贫困冷清的景象。同清灰冷灶”。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
