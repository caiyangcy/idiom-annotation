Without the consistent protection and support from the U.S., would Israel repeatedly defy UN and Security Council resolutions? Would Israel dare to ignore the watchful eyes of its Arab and Islamic neighbors if not for the powerful U.S. carrier battle groups stationed in the Mediterranean in support of it? Without the constant supply of weapons from the U.S., could Israel so recklessly rain down shells on the people of Gaza?\\n\\nSome might argue that the U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need for Israel to protect civilians. However, this rhetoric is not intended for the ears of the Israelis but for the world to hear. In other words, the U.S. is seeking to absolve itself of responsibility and is looking for a way out, playing a double act with Israel. The U.S. has repeatedly vetoed ceasefire resolutions in the Security Council, unilaterally emphasized Israel's right to self-defense, and increased its financial aid to Israel. Political figures, including the President, have continuously visited Israel to show their support.\","}, {"context": "### Idiom: 名过其实\n### Meaning: 名声超过实际才能。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
