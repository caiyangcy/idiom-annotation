Occasionally, he would meet a few close friends at the Shanshui Pavilion and pour a few glasses of wine with him. Go home with a strong smell of alcohol. Although the father is not good at playing cards, he will get upset and get angry when the children make noises. If grandma comes to visit at this time, the father will still be respectful and smile. He is completely different from the previous one. He does not look angry at all, and he is cautious. For fear of neglect, I stopped yelling at my mother.

Although these high-tech engineering projects can boost the economy in the short term, they cannot bring long-term income to the local area. In addition, the local fiscal transparency is lacking, and the government uses large-scale fiscal transfer payments and borrowing to make the economic figures \"swell\" and \"fatten\", but once it enters the repayment period, it will face a crisis.

I believe that the land finance will face greater risks."}]
