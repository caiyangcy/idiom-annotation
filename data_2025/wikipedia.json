According to a 2013 report by *Sing Tao Daily*, an internal evaluation by the Hong Kong government indicated that constructing the exhibition centre expansion above the Wan Chai Ferry Pier Bus Terminus could only proceed within the confines of the above-ground structure. Any ground-level construction would require negotiations with the MTR Corporation, making the implementation of the expansion plan seem far off. Furthermore, the expansion might worsen traffic congestion in the area during construction.

Subsequently, the Mexican Academy transported his remains back to Mexico City, where he was buried in the city's Rotunda of Illustrious Persons (Spanish: ). Mexican literature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Spanish: ) was deeply influenced by Modernism, and Tablada initially followed this trend. His poetry bore clear Symbolist elements and a rebellious spirit during this period, with representative works including the controversial *Black Mass* (Spanish: ) and *Onyx* (Spanish: ):1-2. Tablada was also influenced by Eastern cultures and was deeply fascinated by China and Japan. He even visited Japan, where he engaged closely with and gained a deeper understanding of Japanese culture. He studied forms such as haiku and tanka, and the brevity yet unique imagery of haiku ultimately transformed Tablada's poetic style. His poetry gradually broke free from the constraints of ornate forms, rich imagery, and melancholic tones, a shift marked by the publication of his poetry collection *A Day* (Spanish: ), which signaled his transition from Modernism to avant-garde. Additionally, Tablada excelled in painting and had a passion for viewing and studying ukiyo-e works. He believed that poetry and painting were complementary art forms, a concept particularly evident in his 1920 publication *Li Po and Other Poems* (Spanish: ). Scholar Willard Bohn also pointed out that Tablada's \\\"poetry paired with images\\\" and \\\"mutual interpretation of poetry and images\\\" were influenced by Guillaume Apollinaire's visual poetry.

His poetry during this period was heavily symbolic and rebellious, with notable works including the controversial \\\"Black Mass\\\" and \\\"Jade.\\\" He was also influenced by Eastern cultures, particularly China and Japan, which he admired greatly. He had visited Japan himself, gaining a close understanding of Japanese culture, and studied haiku and short songs. The unique imagery of haiku eventually transformed Tablada's poetic style, gradually freeing his poetry from the constraints of elaborate forms, rich imagery, and melancholic tones. The publication of his poetry collection \\\"One Day\\\" marked a shift from Modernism to avant-garde. Moreover, Tablada was skilled in painting and was fond of observing and studying ukiyo-e works. He believed that poetry and painting could complement each other, a view that was particularly evident in his 1920 publication \\\"Li Bai and Other Poems.\\\" Scholar Ward M. Burnet also noted that Tablada's \\\"illustrated poems\\\" and \\\"interpretations between text and image\\\" were influenced by Guillaume Apollinaire's visual poetry, though Tablada himself denied any such influence.\","}, {"context": "### Idiom: 沉厚寡言\n### Meaning: 朴实稳重，不爱多说话。同沉重少言”。\n**The meaning above is for reference.

Subsequently, his body was transported back to Mexico City by the Colegio de M\\u00e9xico and buried in the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres (Spanish: Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres) in the city. The literature of Mexico at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century (Spanish: Literatura mexicana de finales del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX) was heavily influenced by modernism, and Tablada also followed the modernist trend in his early years. His poetry was marked by a strong symbolic quality and a rebellious spirit. Representative works from this period include \\\"Misa Negra\\\" (Spanish: Misa Negra) and \\\"Onyx\\\" (Spanish: \\u00d3nice), which provoked critical attention. Tablada was also captivated by Eastern culture, particularly that of China and Japan. He traveled to Japan, where he engaged closely with and understood Japanese culture, studying haiku and tanka. The unique and concise imagery of haiku ultimately transformed Tablada's poetic style, leading his work to gradually free itself from the constraints of elaborate form, rich imagery, and melancholic tones. The publication of the poetry collection \\\"One Day\\\" (Spanish: Un d\\u00eda) marked the transition of his style from modernism to avant-garde. In addition to his poetic talents, Tablada was skilled in painting and had a deep appreciation for ukiyo-e, believing that poetry and painting could complement each other. This is particularly evident in his 1920 publication, \\\"\\u2018Li Bai\\u2019 and Other Poems\\\" (Spanish: \\u2018Li Bai\\u2019 y otros poemas). Scholar Willard Bohn noted that Tablada's \\\"poems with illustrations\\\" and \\\"poetic and pictorial interpretations\\\" were influenced by Guillaume Apollinaire's calligrammes, although Tablada himself denied such influence:4:191-192.\","}, {"context": "### Idiom: 沉厚寡言\n### Meaning: 朴实稳重，不爱多说话。同沉重少言”。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
