The two of them had no script or any information, and they began their 8-day \"adventure\" journey. Their first task was to challenge the \"luxurious sea view picnic\". Just looking for a suitable location and food made their feet ache.

Reading every day, from nine o'clock in the morning until eleven o'clock, and from one o'clock in the afternoon until five o'clock; 2. Readers must return the books they have borrowed through the librarian, and they are not allowed to take or give books at will, so as to avoid loss; 3. Readers are not allowed to chant loudly, for fear that the sound waves will disturb others' thoughts; 4. If you want to borrow a book that someone is currently reading, you must wait for them to finish reading, and you cannot demand it; 5. For each book you read, you can only take one at a time, and only after you finish reading can you read another; 6. The best way to benefit from reading is to take notes."}]
