When the two钦差大臣, Yili Bu and Zhiqian, were stationed in Zhejiang, he was instinctively opposed. After receiving Yili Bu's letter about the ceasefire in Zhejiang, he did not believe it, and sent secret agents to潜往英军占据的定海, collect intelligence, and concluded that the \"pacification\" measures of Yili Bu and Qishan would fail. Therefore, he submitted a memorial to the emperor, which in essence cancelled the imperial edict issued on November 17, declaring the ceasefire. After Zhiqian and Yili Bu took over the \"pacification\" affairs, and Lin Zexu was dismissed from office, he was even more closely related to him. According to Lin Zexu's diary, he spent 35 days in Zhejiang, only 5 days without meeting, two of which were because he went to Dingshan and could not meet. He thought that everything in front of him was incredibly dangerous. He was unable to find any way to repel the enemy, and only thought that it was to pacify the people. At a time when the morale in Hangzhou was falling, it also stopped the panic and looting in the city, so the people supported him, and his official reputation was high. He seemed to have thought of death. In his memorial, he said that if the war and defense were not successful, \"I could only donate my body to repay the emperor's kindness, but I could not use one hand to lift the hearts of a million people\". When the situation became desperate, the neighboring province of Jiangsu, where the governor was ill, he had a secret desire. He submitted a memorial again on February 29, 1842, asking to send Yili Bu to Zhejiang to \"repay his crime\". The emperor did not approve of the suggestion to send Yili Bu to Zhejiang, but only sent a military commander to Suzhou for entertainment. The British army in Ningbo repeatedly released the wind that they would attack Hangzhou. Liushe was shocked and horrified. He had planned and built the most solid defense works in his life. The outstanding officials he met were also Yili Bu. If these could not stop the \"enemy's aggression\", what could be expected? He was unwilling to accept the reality, but could not help but not accept it. The emperor sent a general to the front line in曹娥江 in February, and Liushe calmed down. But 20 days later, this stupid general fled to Hangzhou. Liushe fell to the bottom again and was heartbroken. He ordered only one person, General Yining, to enter the city, and he refused to let his troops enter the city. In the eyes of many people today, advocating \"pacification\" is a retreat. But from Liushe's point of view, it is a deepening of his thoughts. His previous advocacy of \"attack\" was盲目, and now he is advocating \"pacification\" based on reality.
