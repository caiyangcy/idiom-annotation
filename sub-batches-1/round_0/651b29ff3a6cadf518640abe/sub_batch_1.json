You should look up the meaning of the idiom when uncertain.**\n\nTranslated by gpt4; Corpus: web", "source": "夏洛在学校干的坏事传到了家长们的耳中，他们聚集到学校要求学校开除夏洛。夏洛将冬梅误认为邱雅，他刻意模仿马冬梅的走路姿势、笑声以及训练动作，只为搏得女神一笑，马冬梅见夏洛如此侮辱自己，再也装不下去了，转过身来原形毕露准备揍夏洛。闻讯，原先要求开除夏洛的家长们争先恐后地与夏洛妈攀关系，十分滑稽。", "target": "The bad things that Xiao Luo did at school reached the ears of the parents, and they gathered at the school to demand that Xiao Luo be expelled. Xiao Luo mistook Dongmei for Qiuya, and he deliberately imitated Dongmei's walking posture, laughter, and training movements, just to make the goddess smile. When Dongmei saw Xiao Luo insult her like this, she couldn't pretend anymore and turned around to reveal her true form, ready to beat up Xiao Luo. Upon hearing this, the parents who originally demanded Xiao Luo's expulsion scrambled to build a relationship with Xiao Luo's mother, which was very comical."}]
