The most fundamental difference is that \"passing the flower while beating the drum\" is just a game, aimed at entertainment. Regardless of winning or losing, everyone's attitude is generally relaxed, and in the end, it can bring joy to both body and mind. However, the purpose of \"stock trading\" is to make money. It is a risky investment activity. Sometimes the risk is quite high, especially when the investor uses leverage, the risk becomes even greater. Although some investors boast about their \"game\" from time to time, the outcome of the \"game\" is often unbearable. Because it involves real money and the increase or decrease of personal wealth, the stakes are high. When \"trading stocks\", it's hard for investors to control their own attitude. The off-site \"drumbeat\" changes rapidly, or the next person urges \"fast, fast, fast\", the handover action immediately deforms. Sometimes what you think you've received is a \"colored ball\", but what you actually get is a \"bomb\". What you think you've passed on is a \"bomb\", but it turns out to be a real big \"colored ball\". Since it's a game, the aim is to entertain, so winning or losing doesn't really matter."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 逸兴遄飞\n### Meaning: 指超逸豪放的意兴勃发飞扬。\n**The meaning above is for reference.

This is to develop conscience. Compared with the whole country, the local area is certainly a part, but compared with the jurisdiction, the local area is not the whole. In some places, short-sighted decision-making to obtain temporary profits is common, and short-term behavior of killing the goose to obtain the eggs often occurs, and it is all related to the lack of strategic thinking. First, we must improve our political stance, learn to look at issues politically, establish a firm political stance, grasp the political direction, strengthen political determination, temper political character, always keep political responsibilities in mind, and be a politically sensible person."}]
