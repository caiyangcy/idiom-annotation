It's just a tea cup storm. After that, he said it lightly, and it was reported in January that Visit Saudi's sponsorship deal for the Women's World Cup was about to be implemented. If it wasn't for the fact that the female players stood up and opposed it, the consequences would be unimaginable. As Miedema, the Dutch star of Arsenal, described, FIFA should feel ashamed for once considering this deal, and it is ironic that a country with almost no women's rights sponsors the Women's World Cup. Fortunately, it didn't happen in the end."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 粗中有细\n### Meaning: 表面似乎粗率，实际却很细致；平时比较粗率，有时却很细致。\n**The meaning above is for reference.

The serving is so large that it is exaggerated, and the entire soup is packed in a large bowl. When you order this spicy soup, you will get red tea or winter melon tea, which is similar to a set meal. The soup head is thick and fine, with a fragrance and spiciness, and it is not greasy, which is different from the mindless spicy flavors of most spicy soup broths. I think it is awesome, and you should definitely drink it hot because the flavor will be better. There are beef slices, gong bao pork, millet blood, stinky tofu, duck blood, tofu skin, and vegetables in the soup. The main dish is the king's noodles. The ingredients are all very delicious, especially the duck blood and tofu. However, because the serving is so large, people with normal appetites are not recommended to order."}]
