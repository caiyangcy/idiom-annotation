Although some investors boast about their \"game\" from time to time, the outcome of the \"game\" is often unbearable. Because it involves real money and the increase or decrease of personal wealth, the stakes are high. When \"trading stocks\", it's hard for investors to control their own attitude. The off-site \"drumbeat\" changes rapidly, or the next person urges \"fast, fast, fast\", the handover action immediately deforms. Sometimes what you think you've received is a \"colored ball\", but what you actually get is a \"bomb\".
