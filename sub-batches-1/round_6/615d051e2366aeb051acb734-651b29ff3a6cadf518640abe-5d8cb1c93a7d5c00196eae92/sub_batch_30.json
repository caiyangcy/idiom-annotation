The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly requires that the previous slogan style be changed. We should make more use of \"widespread, profound, popular and concise\" propaganda and agitation methods such as drama. It is necessary to \"intensify the work of lower-level officers and soldiers in the most certain aspects\" and use various literary and artistic forms to \"mobilize all our combatants, guerrillas, Red Army members, and agency staff to hold talks, propaganda, and get-togethers with their middle- and lower-level officers and soldiers , sing, act, treat them as one of their own family, conduct confidential negotiations with their units and even companies, platoons, and squads, and perfunctory orders from superiors to attack... This transformed the 67th Army politically. \"Internal work\" for a reliable anti-Japanese army is to establish the Chinese Communist Party organization as the basis in the Northeast Army and \"create a strong core of leadership in the Northeast Army\" so as to \"unify the lower-level officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army under the political goal of resisting Japan and saving the nation.\" \"Rise up and create a strong grassroots foundation and driving force for the Northeast Army,\" pushing senior generals and even the entire Northeast Army to become anti-Japanese friendly forces. Zhou Enlai personally directed the Central Northeast Army Working Committee to establish a training class for Northeast Army cadres, and gathered more than 120 middle- and lower-level officers from three divisions of the Northeast Army captured in the Battle of Laoshan, Yulinqiao, and Zhiluo Town in Wayao. A study class (i.e., the \"White Army Officer Company\") was opened in the fort. Central leaders such as Mao Zedong, Bo Gu, Deng Yingchao, and Peng Dehuai gave lectures in person, and paid travel expenses to send them back to the Northeastern Army."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 唯妙唯肖\n### Meaning: 形容描写或模仿得非常巧妙，非常逼真。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
