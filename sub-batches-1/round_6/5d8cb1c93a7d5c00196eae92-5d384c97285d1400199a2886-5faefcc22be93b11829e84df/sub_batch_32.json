Regarding Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, Beijing's pre-emptive intimidation failed to achieve its full effect and was once burdened by the manipulation of public opinion. Therefore, the military exercise encircling Taiwan must be ground-breaking in order to demonstrate China's will to step up and highlight the intimidation suffered by the United States and Taiwan. However, as of this year's Cai-Mai Conference, the deterrent effect of the previous military exercise around Taiwan is still there, and the narrative of \"de-escalation\" has been formed long before the military exercise. At present, China has not responded to public opinion and There is an urgent need to increase the intensity of military exercises. There is no need to break various records like last year. After all, the purpose of this time is not to break the ground, but to maintain the established narrative and intensity of deterring US-Taiwan collusion. Of course, this does not mean that Beijing has given up its efforts to \"slice the sausage\" in the Taiwan Strait, but there are many available tools in the Sino-US game. Regardless of the display of force or political negotiations, they are only means in nature, and China's national interests are the ultimate goal."}, {"context": "### Idiom: 骆驿不绝\n### Meaning: 骆驿往来不断，前后相继。来来往往，接连不断，前后相继。形容或车马等前后相接，连续不断。\n**The meaning above is for reference.
