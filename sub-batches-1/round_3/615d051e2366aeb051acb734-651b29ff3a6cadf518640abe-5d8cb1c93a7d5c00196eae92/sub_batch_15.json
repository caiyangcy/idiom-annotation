On the day of the house handover, they are often very excited and may be at a loss when faced with issues such as: how to inspect the house; what are the procedures for the house handover; how much money needs to be paid at the house handover; what to do if there are problems with the house; what qualifies as a quality issue with the house, etc. \n\n(II) The issue of hollowing in the wall: The problem of hollowing between the surface and the inner layer of the wall cannot be detected by the naked eye. It can be judged by the sound emitted when knocking on the wall. If a \"thud\" sound is produced, it indicates that there is hollowing inside. If it is a load-bearing wall, there are serious quality issues with the house; if it is a non-load-bearing wall, the wall surface needs to be reprocessed, that is, re-netting, plastering, etc., otherwise, after a period of time after the completion of the decoration, the wall surface will protrude outward, minor cases will show cracks, and severe cases will cause the wall skin to fall off; If a crisp \"pop\" sound is produced, it indicates that there is a slight gap between the surface and the wall, and there is no need for repair treatment, it can be leveled when applying putty."}]
