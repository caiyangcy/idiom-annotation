Among the governors and governors of various provinces, Liu Yunke can be regarded as a special case. He is not a Hanlin scholar, a Jinshi, or even a civil servant. He is just a Gongsheng student in the Imperial College, and he can be regarded as a legitimate family background. He is not a nobleman, or a Manchu. There is no record of his ancestors in the historical books, so he is just an ordinary family. In the Daoguang Dynasty, which emphasized academic qualifications and family status, Liu Yunke was assigned to the Ministry of Punishment as a seventh-grade junior official. In 1826, he officially filled the vacancy, and he was actually in charge. Yuanwailang, Langzhong, magistrate, Taoist, inspector and chief envoy climbed up the ranks. In August 1840, he replaced the unlucky Wuer Gong'e and became the governor of Zhejiang. In this short period of 14 years, Ding was also included. His father worried about staying at home for three years. Liu Yunke took a fast train in his official career, not by chance, but by his unique way of office life: first, he was solid in doing things; second, he was a well-behaved person. The former is in line with the political purpose of Emperor Daoguang. , the latter made him very popular in the officialdom. For example, the imperial envoys Yilibu and Yuqian were stationed in Zhenhai successively, but they seemed not to care about the defense of the place. As the governor of Zhejiang, Liu Yunke felt responsible, not because of his superiors. There was an imperial envoy who gave up his responsibility and went there several times to persuade and take care of the matter. After the matter was completed, he did not make any publicity, but attributed the credit to Yi Yu. When he submitted the memorial, he just said lightly: \"The reason why he should add more projects \"Iribu will report separately\" and \"hereinafter ordered by the Imperial Envoy Yu Qian.\" His approach naturally pleased the superiors, but the bland words in the memorial also revealed the subtext behind it, which seemed to be an implicit reminder. Emperor Daoguang: He was the one who contributed. In the Opium War, Liu Yunke was at best a second-rate role. Although he was the highest military and political officer of Zhejiang Province, where the war was the most complicated, there were three imperial envoys above him (Iribu, Yuqian, Qiying) and a general (Yijing). He was not really in charge. The reason why he was eye-catching was his main \"fu\" remarks. However, at the beginning of the war, he was an authentic and uncompromising person. At the end of 1840, when Liu Yunke rushed from Sichuan to Zhejiang to take up his new post, he made up his mind to fight a bloody battle with the \"rebellious barbarians\". But when he saw the actions of Iribu, who was in charge of Zhejiang's military affairs at this time, he was instinctively disgusted. When he received Iribu's letter about the truce in Zhejiang, he didn't believe it at all. He sent another spy to sneak into Dinghai occupied by the British army to collect intelligence, and concluded that the British army would occupy Dinghai for a long time. Iribu and Qishan's \" The move to \"fusi\" was bound to fail. Therefore, he reported the information to Emperor Daoguang, and also made some slight criticisms of Yi Qi, hiding the needle in his heart. He knew that due to his status, it was impossible to persuade Yi Qi, so he relied on Emperor Daoguang's divine power to suppress Yi Qi. Qi. As expected, Emperor Daoguang issued the decree. Iribu was dissatisfied with this. He wrote two memorials to ridicule Liu for \"not exhausting his explorations\" and \"there are still untrue things.\" \"The visit is more genuine.\" Liu Yunke did not give up. Instead, he and Yan Botao jointly submitted a memorial, saying that Yilibu \"even though he can inspire people, but Xiang praises business plans, but he has few helpers\" and asked to send Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen to Zhejiang. , \"jointly with Yiribu to prepare a response to the attack and suppression\", and was given the power to submit memorials exclusively, so as not to be controlled by Yiribu. During the period when Qishan and Yiribu were in charge of \"Fu Yi\" affairs, shortly after Lin Zexu and Deng Tingzhen stepped down. , Liu Yunke’s remarks and behavior have their own dazzling scenery. The British also paid great attention to this. The \"China Series\" published in February 1841 commented on this: \"Under the jurisdiction of the new governor Liu Yunke, the situation in Zhoushan has changed Deterioration\"; the imperial edict promoted by Liu Yunke \"has essentially canceled the armistice order announced in the edict on November 17.\" After Yuqian took charge of Zhejiang, the two had similar interests and cooperated tacitly. Liu Yunke enthusiastically participated in the defense projects of Dinghai and Zhenhai Construction. Yuqian said that Liu \"loved the people like a son and was skillful in controlling the army.\" After Lin Zexu came to Zhejiang with the title of fourth-rank minister, Liu Yunke got along with him day and night. According to Lin Zexu's diary, he stayed in Zhejiang for 35 days, only 5 days and two. They never met each other, including two days because Liu went to Dinghai and could not meet. Lin Zexu was later assigned to Xinjiang, and Liu also went to his residence to see him off. Just when everything was going as planned, and Liu Yunke was full of ambitions, in October 1841, the British army fell into Dinghai, Zhenhai, and Ningbo. , three generals were killed in battle, and Yuqian committed suicide. Liu Yunke was horrified when he heard what he heard. The Dinghai and Zhenhai defense projects were the strongest fortifications he could imagine and build, and Yuqian and others were the strongest he had ever encountered. Excellent officials, if even these are not enough to withstand the fierce flames of \"rebellion\", then what else can they expect? They are unwilling to accept reality but cannot deny it. Horror is followed by deep thought. The enthusiasm for \"suppression\" is caused by the front line Fading away due to defeat. So, he wrote a sentence in the memorial that was clear in meaning but ambiguous in terms: Since ancient times, Fucha's method of controlling foreign barbarians has been to fight, defend, and pacify. Today's war, defense is unfavorable, and pacifying the ministers is not possible. He was ignorant and mediocre, and was really helpless. Not long after, he received an order from Fa Qishan to serve in Zhejiang. Thinking that Emperor Daoguang's attitude had changed, he hurriedly issued a memorial on October 30, 1842, requesting that Iribu be sent to Zhejiang. \"Effectiveness to atone\". The suggestion of using Iribu was sternly rejected by Emperor Daoguang. However, the generals sent by Emperor Daoguang to show off their power were only heard of having fun in Suzhou. The British army in Ningbo City repeatedly attempted to attack Hangzhou. Liu Yunke had no soldiers and no generals. There was no way to defeat the enemy, but he felt that everything in front of him was extremely dangerous. Although he worked hard in Hangzhou, his defensive measures even he did not believe: he set up wooden fences at the entrances of the alleys in the city, and used civilians to guard the fences and camp soldiers. One by one, they use flags during the day, lights at night, gongs and bangs... All these measures are not so much to defend the enemy as to appease the people. But in Hangzhou, where people's hearts are floating, they also stopped people from seizing the opportunity to snatch in panic. As a result, the people supported him, and his official reputation was high. He seemed to have thought about death. The memorial stated: If the battle fails, \"I can only donate my life to repay the kindness of my father, but I cannot use one hand to save the distracted hearts of the people.\" \"When his mood was at its worst, Liang Zhangju, the governor of the neighboring province of Jiangsu, resigned due to illness, which made him secretly envious. So, he resigned on January 29, 1842, claiming that he had suffered from the disease while in office in Sichuan. Fengbi, due to the heavy military duties after arriving in Zhejiang, \"the tongue is numb day by day, a hole in the right waist is collapsed, and the right ear is blocked, and I am forgetful of everything.\" He hoped that Emperor Daoguang could also clear it up, or at least give him a fake treatment. When the building was about to collapse, he had a chance to retreat and save himself. However, the situation was so ruined that Emperor Daoguang had no intention of replacing him, so Zhu Pijia could only comfort him with words. He looked forward to the arrival of the mighty General Yi like the stars and the moon. Finally, in late February 1842, he led his troops to the front line of Cao'e River. Liu Yunke recovered from his shock. But 20 days later, the commander-in-chief was defeated in eastern Zhejiang and rushed to Hangzhou in panic at night. Liu Yunke fell to the bottom again and was heartbroken. He also lost his face and ordered that only Yijing be allowed to enter the city, but refused to allow his troops to stay outside the city. The reasons he later explained were that he was afraid of breaking out and disturbing the city, and secondly, he was afraid of the British army arriving. At this time, everything All efforts failed, and all hopes were shattered. The little fighting spirit that still existed deep in Liu Yunke's mind was wiped out. He went against his usual well-behaved habits, and regardless of the possibility of disobeying the holy will, in 1842 On March 21, 2011, a famous \"Ten Kelu\" memorial was published. In the folder of the memorial, he once again requested to use Iribu. This old officer who had been hurt by him was described again in his writings. It is: \"The public is loyal to the country and has no desire for quick success and fame. This is the only person I have ever seen in my life.\" From Lin Zexu to Yilibu, Liu Yunke's thoughts turned 180 degrees. Today. In the eyes of many people, switching from focusing on \"suppression\" to focusing on \"pacification\" is undoubtedly a step backward. However, from the example of Liu Yunke, we can clearly see the progress in the deepening of his thoughts. Previously, he strongly advocated \"suppression\" , but it was lost in blindness. At this time, the \"Fu\" discussion was focused on reality. After Qishan and Yilibu were dismissed, the \"Fu\" discussion had been dormant for a year, and the \"suppression\" idea was boiling. Here. It is quite risky to advocate \"pacification\" under such circumstances, and no matter what the holy intention is, even the slander in words is unbearable. Liu Yunke is worthy of being a master in the officialdom. He did not directly propose \"pacification\". \" Instead, they made a fuss about the word \"suppression\", saying that if the war continued, there would be ten \"deeply dangerous\" factors. Originally, as long as \"suppression\" was proved to be unfeasible, \"pacification\" would be taken for granted. Let us analyze Liu Yunke's \"Ten Considerations.\" The first one is: The Qing army in Zhejiang suffered two setbacks, and its energy was completely wiped out, and it is difficult to recover. The second one is: Continue to mobilize the northwest troops, which are far away from Zhejiang, so it is not possible to slow them down. Urgent. The third point is: The British army's firearms are extremely fierce and irresistible. The fourth point is: The British army is not bad at land warfare. The fifth point is: Even if the Qing army is lucky enough to win on land, the British army can board the boat and escape, and the Qing army can only \" Looking at the ocean and sighing.\" The sixth one said: The British army used small favors to win over the people and they were at peace with each other. The people \"turned to worry about the invasion of large soldiers, which is why people rarely share the same hatred of the enemy.\" The seventh one said: \"The large soldiers have been defeated repeatedly, and the enemy is arrogant and we are discouraged. Not only is it difficult to attack Qi, but it is also extremely difficult to defend.\" The eighth chapter says: Zhejiang's grain harvest is mostly incomplete, \"sometimes less than half of it has been harvested\", \"all due to unfavorable conditions.\" The ninth chapter says: Zhejiang's snow disaster last year , Hang, Hu, Shao and other prefectures, \"bandits gathered to rob and rob, and the situation was extremely violent.\" Although it was \"suddenly caused by a snowstorm, in fact, it was the right thing to cause trouble. The bandits knew that the local officials could not take care of both, so they flouted the law and committed crimes.\" When people's hearts are shaken, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be instigated by each other, and they will disperse and gather again. After last year's snow disaster, many spring flowers have not been planted. Now the prices of rice, wheat and vegetables are increasing day by day, and the ordinary people are having a hard time. Even before this The traitors have not been able to gather together, and there are not some unscrupulous people taking advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of the security?\" These words touched the inner ailment of Emperor Daoguang. The opposition between the government and the people was like water and fire, and there was a profound crisis lurking within the Qing Dynasty. Natural disasters , rising prices... any small spark may ignite into a prairie fire. More than ten years later, the national civil war, dominated by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, proved this point. At this time, the popular rebellion led by Zhong Renjie in Hubei reminded us again. Liu Yunke paid special attention to this point. After the fall of Zhenhai and Ningbo, he asked for reinforcements and at the same time requested the return of the 5,000 rural warriors Yuqian had recruited in Henan, Anhui and other places during his lifetime. He wrote: Recruiting from neighboring provinces The local braves must have elite troops in the province to control the bells. We can recruit the help of the local braves so as not to cause trouble. Now there are bandits in our province who are looting and causing trouble. The people's hearts are shaken and it is not easy to suppress them. If we recruit the thugs from neighboring provinces, If he leads thieves into the house, he will definitely collude and cause trouble, which will bring little benefit and great harm. Emperor Daoguang admired his acumen very much. Zhu Pi said: \"What I saw has profound meaning, but I have not seen it.\" After the failure of the counterattack in eastern Zhejiang, Liu Yunke also ordered the local officials to collect the weapons of the defeated warriors to prevent them from causing trouble. Fearing that Zhejiang would not be able to collect them all, he asked the governors of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shandong and other provinces to conduct \"inspections as one body\" to \"avoid trouble.\" Liu Yunke The fear of hiring brave men to cause trouble is greater than that of the British army that is raging in eastern Zhejiang. It is precisely because of the deep consideration of the fate of the dynasty. The British army, whose purpose is to cede territory, pay compensation, and trade, has no intention of destroying the Qing Dynasty; and once the people Rebellion will be the fall of the crown. Although the rulers of the Qing Dynasty were confused and confused on many matters, they were very clear-headed on this fundamental plan. Liu Yunke was the first person to consider these two things together. \"The unscrupulous people took advantage of the opportunity.\" The phrase \"rising\" is a reminder to Emperor Daoguang and even the entire ruling group, and it is also the most effective pressure exerted on them. From the perspective of national and national interests, Liu Yunche's theory is completely wrong; but from the perspective of dynasty interests To make a judgment, let’s make another argument. The tenth point is: The defense expenditure of the seven provinces is very huge, \"Is it a waste of money to pay for the troops?\" War must be backed by money. No matter how sharp the bayonet is, if it is withdrawn, it will become the backbone. The military expenditures were as soft as rushes. During the war, what upset Emperor Daoguang the most was probably the issue of military expenditures. There is no accurate statistics on how much the Qing Dynasty spent on the Opium War. As far as I have seen. According to the archives, only the reimbursement figures for the following eight provinces were found: Zhejiang 7,480,521 taels; Jiangxi 224,016 taels; Guangdong 6,244,760 taels; Sichuan 167,370 taels; Jiangsu 1,302,400 taels; Shaanxi 115,851 taels; Hubei 333,567 taels; and Guangxi 90,720 taels. . . . . . . The above eight provinces total 16.37 million taels. Of course, the actual expenditure is larger than the reimbursement figure, because the reimbursement figures of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces do not include the money donated by the province (which may not be included in the reimbursement), and according to what I have seen Far from complete information, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces donated 4.76 million taels of silver and 850,000 strings of money. Liu Yunke's \"Ten Considerations\" was one of the few documents during the entire war that could face reality and analyze it in detail. What he proposed The ten \"deeply worrying\" items are all facts that have already occurred or hidden dangers that exist in reality. Not only was he unable to understand this, but no one in the Qing Dynasty could explain it either. Today's historians are studying opium. In times of war, these issues should be faced squarely.
